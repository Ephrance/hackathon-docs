# Hackathon Docs

A set of resources and docs from past hackathons. In the future, we may spin this into it's own fully fledged "Mojaloop Hackathon Guide". For now, it's a place to put reference material.

Most of this initial material comes from The Include Everyone Mojaloop Hackathon in Kampala, Uganda late 2019.

If you have additional material you want to add, or changes you want to make, please go ahead and raise a pull request.
